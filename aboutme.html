    <img class="img" src="imagetwo.jpg" alt="Avatar">
    <p class="p">My name is Michael Aikawa. I was born in San Francisco, California. I was raised in Piedmont, California and attended Beach Elementary School, Piedmont Middle School, and am currently a junior at Piedmont High School. I am a student-athlete, that constantly plays and practices baseball. In my free time I like to play sports with my friends, hang out with family, and give back to my community. I live with my parents, Mark and Marianne, my two sisters, Megan and Madison, and my golden retriever./</p>
