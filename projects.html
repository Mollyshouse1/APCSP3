    <p><b>Poetry Video:</b> For a recent english project I had to read a poem in a video and uses images to describe the poem. Reading the poem, I thought the poet was describing that sometimes when people put in tons of hard work, there is little reward, but that is part of the challenge in life. I am going to present my video to the class later this week.</p>

    <p><b>Spanish Presentation:</b> For a recent spanish project my partener, Christian, and I had to research a spanish-speaking country and present to the class the information we got from our research. I learned a lot about Colombia and how they are one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. In addition, they have over 4,000 species of orchids. Christian and I will be presenting our project during finals week.  </p>
